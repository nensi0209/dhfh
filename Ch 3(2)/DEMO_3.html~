	<p> DHTML allows scripting languages to change variables in a web page's definition language, which in turn affects the look 
	and function of otherwise "static" HTML page content, after the page has been fully loaded and during the viewing process. 
	Thus the dynamic characteristic of DHTML is the way it functions while a page is viewed, not in its ability to generate a 
	unique page with each page load.
